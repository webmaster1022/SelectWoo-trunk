selectWoo
=======
selectWoo is a fork of [select2](https://github.com/select2/select2) with improved accessibility. 

selectWoo is also optimized for WordPress plugin development and is designed to be able to run alongside versions of select2 that other plugins may be using.

**Usage**: 

[Usage is the same as select2](https://select2.github.io/examples.html), but can also be initialized with `.selectWoo()`. `.select2()` initialization has been kept for full backwards compatibility. If other versions of select2 are potentially going to be running on the same site, initializing elements with `.selectWoo()` is recommended.

You can enqueue the select2 or the selectWoo js and css files in the dist folder. They are the same.

**Accessibility Testing**:

[Here are samples that can be used for accessibility testing.](https://woocommerce.github.io/selectWoo/accessibility-testing/)
